Hi! I'm Sonya, a junior computer science student at Carnegie Mellon University.
This is a web page for the course 15-400 Research Practicum in Computer Science.
It will contain the project proposal for the project I will be participating in
during the spring of 2016, as well as progress updates along the way and the
final materials.s
