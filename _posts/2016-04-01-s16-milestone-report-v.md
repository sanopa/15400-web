The current progress report can be found [here][report].
The current code can be found here: [Python code][python].
I did not include the Lisp output this time because with two dependency parsers
the script takes a very long time to run, so when I introduce a small change I
need to run the script to its completion to reflect is completely, whereas I
usually only run it until there is enough output that I can look at its
correctness.
